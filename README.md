# Cpp-Python-integration-

This project was created for an SNHU class.

The purpose was to demonstrate using python within a C++ program. This takes a list of items and manipulates the data to list the number of times each item appears in the list and create a simple histogram of all items.

For the scope of the project submission, I feel I did a decent job using the different capabilites of each language.

The code could be enhanced by removing unused functions and better optimizing the c++ section for the strengths of c++

The most challenging part was determining how to write for a windows deployment while using a mac. While it was not terribly difficult, all prior experience had been with languages that are not platform dependent.

Integrating languages on the backend will be useful in the future, so long as I can recognize when and where a different langugage would be beneficial.

For readability and maintability I named built and named functions and variables in standard style and tried to ensure functions have one particular use. If a particular feature needs to be updated then only the relevant function can be changed without needing to rewrite every use of that function
